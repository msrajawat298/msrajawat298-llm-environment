# llm-environment Docker Image

This Docker image is built on the official Ubuntu image and is configured to run a Streamlit application with specific dependencies. The image includes a pre-installation script and a requirements file to set up the necessary environment.

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, use the following commands:

```bash
docker build -t msrajawat298/llm-environment .
```

## Pushing the Docker Image to Docker Hub

If you haven't logged in to Docker Hub, log in using the following command:

```bash
docker login
```

Now, push the built image to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push msrajawat298/llm-environment
```

## Usage

To use this Docker image in your environment, you can pull it from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull msrajawat298/llm-environment
```

Then, you can run a container based on this image:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 msrajawat298/llm-environment
```

This will expose the Streamlit application on port 8501.

## Dockerfile Details

The Dockerfile included in this repository uses the official Ubuntu image as the base image. It sets the working directory to `/app`, copies the `pre-install.sh` and `requirements.txt` files, installs Python and required dependencies, and exposes port 8501 for the Streamlit application.

## pre-install.sh

The `pre-install.sh` script updates the package list, installs Python3 and pip, and installs the Python packages specified in `requirements.txt`.

## requirements.txt

The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python packages and their versions required for this environment. These include:

- langchain==0.0.284
- python-dotenv==1.0.0
- streamlit==1.22.0
- tiktoken==0.4.0
- faiss-cpu==1.7.4
- protobuf~=3.19.0
- google-generativeai
- InstructorEmbedding
- sentence-transformers
```

This README provides clear instructions on building, pushing, and using the Docker image. Feel free to adjust any details based on your specific requirements.
